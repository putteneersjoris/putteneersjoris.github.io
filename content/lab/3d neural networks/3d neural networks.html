            <br> 1) convert 3d geometry into 2d while keeping the information from the points, vertecis and primitives.

                        As this is quite a broad experiment, lets clarify a few things.

            results: 

            we want a machine learning model to run over a selection of "geometry images" and then produce hallucinations of those "geometry images" that we then can decode back into 3d models



            what is a geometry image?
            http://hhoppe.com/proj/gim/


            how can we use geometry images for machine learning purposes?



            what are the kind of geometry images?



            1) geomtry images from pointindeces.
            2) geometry images from unwrapped vector displacement maps

            results in tensorflow
