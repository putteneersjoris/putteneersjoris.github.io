            <br>This setup was originally made as a small showcase for a student, but perhaps it is isefull to some of you. in this short description we create a procedural turntable render from generic models with corresponding textures using PDG. It is divided into 2 parts. 
            <br>1) will cover how we can generate and export generic geometries and textures from Sop and Cop context with PDG. 
            <br>2) will cover how we can make an PDG turntable animation without a dependency on framenumbers using Python
            <br>
            
            
            
            <h3>1.</h3>
            
            <br>Let's lay down a wedge sop that generates 6 workitems, containing an `@index` attribute with an integer value ranging from 0-5.
            this attribute value will be used as an input for the platonic solids type. tip: In some nodes, we can use integers to drive ordered menu's.
            
            <br>next, we'll go to Sop level, we'll unwrap the platonic solid on each `@index`, and generate a random color on the points, also dependant on the `@index`.
            now, let's bring that color information into Cops so we can export it as a texture. in COPS, we layout a VopCop2 generator with a small vex expression
            <br>
            
            
            <p><div class = "code_python"><br><script src="https://gist.github.com/putteneersjoris/8a8190302e0f3837e606421c44bd9404.js"></script> </div></p> 
            
            <br>The <a href = "https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/functions/uvsample.html">uvsample()</a>  function grabs information depending on the coordinates of the "uv" attribute on a geometry string. In this case, we can grab the "Cd" vector and rite it out as RGB values.
            
            This is a technique I came across from <a href = "https://forums.odforce.net/profile/10570-konstantin-magnus/content/" class = "red_links" target = "blank">Konstantin Magnus</a>.</div>
            <br>Now Houdini can save it out as a texture. We can lay down a ropgeometry and a ropcomposite node, each with the `@pdpg_index` attribute in the filename.
            <br>

            <br>
            
            <h3>2.</h3>

            <br>in part 2, we'll see how we can use Python and PDG to make a fully automated turntable . first we'll start by using a file pattern to determine the input folder. With the "*" symbol, we can define all* filenames and extensions. We than use a wedge Top to generate a `@geometry_index` attribute that has the same value as the `@pdg_index`. I just do this for clarification and name conventtions. I follow this wedge node up by another wedge Top. This time setting a rotation attribute from 0 to 360. we will use this later in our Python processor so we are not time dependant.

            <br>we now lay down a python porocessor with the following script:
            <p><div class = "code_python" ><script src="https://gist.github.com/putteneersjoris/95be61f4d8a3ee42d256ca78858015e9.js"></script></script></div> </p>
            <br>this script generates a small node tree at Sop level that will be responsible for the rotation per `@wedgenum`. All parameters are defined in the script. We can now conclude this setup with a rop fetch and an output
