            <br>This setup was originally made as a small showcase for a student, but perhaps it is isefull to some of you. in this short description we create a procedural turntable render from generic models with corresponding textures using PDG. It is divided into 2 parts. 
            <br>1) will cover how we can generate and export generic geometries and textures from Sop and Cop context with PDG. 
            <br>2) will cover how we can make an PDG turntable animation without a dependency on framenumbers using Python
            <br>
            
            
            
            <br> <h3>1)</h3>
            
            <br>Let's lay down a wedge sop that generates 6 workitems, containing an `@index` attribute with an integer value ranging from 0-5.
            this attribute value will be used as an input for the platonic solids type. tip: In some nodes, we can use integers to drive ordered menu's.
            
            <br>next, we'll go to Sop level, we'll unwrap the platonic solid on each `@index`, and generate a random color on the points, also dependant on the `@index`.
            now, let's bring that color information into Cops so we can export it as a texture. in COPS, we layout a VopCop2 generator with a small vex expression

            <br>The <a href = "https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/functions/uvsample.html">uvsample()</a>  function grabs information depending on the coordinates of the "uv" attribute on a geometry string. In this case, we can grab the "Cd" vector and rite it out as RGB values.
            
            This is a technique I came across from <a href = "https://forums.odforce.net/profile/10570-konstantin-magnus/content/" class = "red_links" target = "blank">Konstantin Magnus</a>.</div>
            <br>Now Houdini can save it out as a texture. We can lay down a ropgeometry and a ropcomposite node, each with the `@pdpg_index` attribute in the filename.
