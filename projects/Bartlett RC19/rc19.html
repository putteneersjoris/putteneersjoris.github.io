          The hardware infrastructure needed to support the contemporary media ecologies has a vast material impact on our environment. These material manifestations can be seen in various stages in the lifecycle of digital technology: from extraction of raw materials, transportation and production, to energy needed to operate networks and data centres, to disposal and e-waste. Data centres are essential infrastructures enabling media ecologies, often owned by tech companies, they are used platform economies that use data to extract value form local markets. They are often housed in anonymous

We looked at three platform economy services – uber drivers, food production and delivery, online dating and sex workers - and envisioned how these communities would reclaim three data centres within Los Angeles. The project was designed through web scraping, ripping models of exiting data centres and their environments and remixing them through kitbashing.

        The project looks at the territorial impact of emerging digital technologies across several scales through the lens of resolution. The media ecology enabled through these digital technologies does not manifest itself globally with the same density, both in terms of accessibility of infrastructure and degree of mediation. Resolution is an important measure of understanding our contemporary environment as it manifests itself in the interface between the physical and the digital, the material and the mediated. Digital information is fundamentally stored as discrete data, it represents information at a certain resolution. Resolution, in addition to a technical notion, can be understood as a spatial and

        temporal measure of density of information, with substantial political, economic, social and environmental implications. Resolution can be seen in horizontal territories, delineating borders between hires and lowres zones, as a technical limit of imaging and mapping and technologies. Resolution can be understood vertically in overlays of heterogeneous data sources, in the zoom-levels of digital mapping services. The project explores not only the extremes of connected and unconnected, mediated and unmediated, but is interested in the in-between, the territories where friction, confrontation manifest themselves, and we introduce resolution as means to describe the continuum territories in-between.

        The pervasive impact of digital technologies requires us to rethink notions of knowledge and learning. The current pandemic and the forced shift to online teaching are just the latest example of an ongoing trend of digitizing learning, through online classrooms, MOOCs, video, and interactive tutorials… Digital technologies are not only affecting how we learn, but also what we need to learn, and what is doing the learning. With constant and instant access to information, traditional ways of learning focused on reproducing information are no longer valid. The project reflects on the impact of media ecologies on the blurring of digital and material learning environments,

        questioning the role of educational institutions and infrastructures. By including machine learning, the project speculates on the role of platforms, mixed reality applications, gamification, and questions what skills we must (un)learn as humans navigating Compressed City: hyper-learning & unlearning. Using architectural education as a case study, it proposes an augmented reality learning system distributed within the city. This system questions the role of the institutions and formalized architectural education as gatekeepers of knowledge on urban design and architecture and proposes to use media technology and data to enable a more open relationship with city and public.

        The emergence of the Technosphere, the accidental global megastructure consisting of networked digital technologies, requires us to rethink the dichotomy between the natural and the artificial, and how architecture and urban design operate in the continuum in-between.

        existing and new artificial landscapes, as dynamic digital environments. The archive makes these artificial landscapes accessible through several interfaces, a material architectural archive and a mixed reality application layer within Compressed City, and a digital overlay on actual material landscapes. Archiving artificial landscapes not only creates a system for users to archive the past and present, imagine and speculate about the future, but also helps us think about how to reshape our position in the natural environment.

        As we live our lives increasingly mediated through digital
        interfaces, compression has become an ubiquitous part of our
        technology saturated environments. Compression is defined in
        data science as the reduction of file size or bandwidth needed
        to store or transfer information. Rather than reducing the
        amount of information we consume, compression allows for the
        densification of data, images, video, social media updates, 24 h
        news alerts... Compression can be understood as densification
        of information within the digital, but also as information spilling
        from the mediated spaces of digital technology into lived spaces,
        rewiring the territories we inhabit. As technology becomes
        embedded within our societies, through sensing, mapping and
        tracking technologies, the digital is informed by the material
        world. Compression operates on the interface, the intersection, or
        the blurring between the mediated and lived spaces. 
        Digital technologies are not neutral, access to data and
        computational power depends on economic and political power
        in addition to technological infrastructure. Tech companies and
        digital platforms are emergent economic and political powers
        approaching or even surpassing the wealth and power of
        sovereign nation states. As such, compression can be broader
        understood as having societal, political, economic, experiential,
        aesthetic and spatial dimensions. Vertically compression is
        interconnecting or delaminating different layers of the stacks that
        make up the Technosphere, horizontally compression is ubiquitous
        but unevenly distributed, resulting in hotspots, contested
        territories, in-between zones and shifting borders. <br>
        With technological innovation pushing for an ever increasing
        bandwidth, resolution and framerate, current temporal and
        partial manifestations of compression might be short-lived
        moments on path to a seamless integration of the digital and the
        material. We approach compression as a means of grasping the
        contemporary moment, explore what these dimensions mean for
        design disciplines engaging the complexities of contemporary
        surroundings.

        The topic of compression is framed within a larger interest in current media ecologies, more specifically how digital media and
        communication technologies affect environments. The term Media Ecology was originally devised by Marshal Mc Luhan in the 1960,
        leading to the emergence of media studies as field of research. He understood media as extensions of human capacities and
        argued that media, more than their content, impact how societies and cultures develop. The notion of media ecology was further
        developed by Neil Postman & Walter Ong, who stated that instead of studying media objects themselves, media ecology emphasises
        the relationships between media objects and how they constitute environments. <br>
        Sixty years and several digital revolutions later, the understanding of media as environments gained even more relevance since the emergence of networked distributed digital technologies, where there is no longer a vertical hierarchy between receiver and
        sender. Digital media constitute environments we increasingly spend our lives in: from inboxes, conference calls, professional

        Contemporary media ecologies enabled through digital
        technologies, rely on extensive computational power and
        processing and storage of vast amounts of data. There is nothing
        inherently visual about computation, although data is rendered
        visual through screens for our comprehension. Visualising data
        plays an important role in diverse activities such as science,
        commerce, governance, logistics, warfare... While these activities
        rely on extensive computational power to crunch large sets of
        data, it is in particular cultural production that relies on visual data
        and is computationally expensive. Through sensing technologies
        and digital cameras, vision has increasingly become algorithmic:
        computational visual technologies are not just capturing images of
        the world, but are putting them through computational processes
        of filtering, segmentation, classification, adding metadata and
        tags. Instead of singular static objects, they become part of a
        dynamic ecology of images. <br>
        Most digital imagery is subject to some form of compression,
        which attempt to reduce file size and bandwidth without distorting
        the readability of the image.  Compression attempts to be invisible,
        revealing itself in conditions where bandwidth is scarce. Only
        through errors and glitches, digital images reveal their algorithmic
        qualities, giving a glimpse into the discrete resolution of digital
        files, revealing the mediality, or the materiality of the digital
        medium. Since digital technologies are deeply affecting our
        environments, and understanding their impact is indispensable for
        urban design and architecture, we can learn from practices such
        as media arts and glitch art, that exploit their algorithmic nature.
        Within fieldstation studio we have been developing a research
        trajectory ‘new eyes / algorithmic vision’, which explores how
        architecture and urban design, disciplines relying heavily on the
        visual senses, respond to novel ways of seeing, mapping and
        visualising our world. The media ecologies and visual cultures
        these technologies give rise to, are not merely representing but
        actually shaping the environments in which we operate. Our world
        is increasingly experienced and produced through digital media.
        The research develops strategies for architectural and urban
        design practices to actively engage the complexities of our current
        surroundings through narrative, time-based and computational
        media.
