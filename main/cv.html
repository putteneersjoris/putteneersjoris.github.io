                // I use SideFX Houdini for procedural work, or for the generation of synthetic datasets.
                Houdini has been my main driver for over 7 years. When working with geometric models, I
                mainly output renders from the Karma renderengine. My Houdini expertise extends SOP, VOP,
                LOP, PDG, CHOP &amp; COP levels. I use vex (based on C++) &amp; Hscript as a way to optimize
                node structures and to express computational Logic inside the Houdini Framework.
                <br>
                // I use Blender (+ Cycles, Eevee) for visualisation, world building, art direction and prototyping.
                It is a fast, intuitive and versatile mesh based modeling software that allows me to rapidly
                sketch possible outcomes.
                <br>
                // I use Python as a way to automate tedious tasks, mainly inside Houdini. I also use Python for
                machine learning purposes.
                <br>
                // For optimizing my logistical processes, I use Git as my Version Control platform.
                <br>
                // I mainly use Linux (ubuntu distribution) as my OS. This prevents high-performance
                bottlenecks
